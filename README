What is there
=============
Nothing useful here: just a pet project to experiment with some OpenApi related tooling.

How to launch stuff
===================
This probably requires at least PHP 8

  ./generate.sh
  cd php-server
  composer install
  php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

  # See https://symfony.com/download to get the symfony binary
  symfony server:start --no-tls
